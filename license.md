#Smart Projects Kirby Theme

**Smart Projects** is a [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) based directory which handles all your project data.

##How to install
After downloading just remove the default **assets**, **content** and **site** folder and replace it with the downloaded ones. For optional interface usage you have to install the [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/). 
 
I strictly recommend using it with a **local installation** ([XAMPP](http://sashtown.de/how-to-install-kirby-on-xampp), MAMP etc.) only, so your sensible data and client stuff will be absolutely safe. 

##How to use
You can create your project entries by adding visible subfolders with a corresponding project.txt to the directory folder or - way easier - using the Panel. The prearranged fields - respectively the example text files - are self-explanatory and can be extended the way you prefer it.

###Private projects
Sometimes there may be some own projects or stuff you did for a family member or a friend. So you won't have any client IDs for that kind of data. Just add "private" to the client ID field and it will be listed in the private section.

###Print/PDF
I just coded some basic print styles to make sure that unimportant parts of the project template won't appear on your print document. You may create a special and customized print stylesheet according to your personal needs, to convert the data of a project to a PDF file for example.

###Extended usage
Furthermore you can make use of Kirby's natural folder structure and put other important documents - like invoices or domain acquisition requests - in your project folders. So you've got all the data you might need in the future at one place.

There's a bunch of more possibilities to customize the theme for your own needs and preferences. So go ahead and fork it!
